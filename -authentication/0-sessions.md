## Sessions

Have you ever wondered how websites remember who you are?  Sessions & Cookies! 

The (overly) simplest way to think about it is this:
1. Websites set cookies in your browser.
2. Those cookies act as a DataBase ID.
3. Your browser sends that cookie back to the server every time you access the website.
4. The server looks up your stored personal info in a separate mini-database.
