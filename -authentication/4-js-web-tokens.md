## JavaScript Web Tokens


Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. 

This module lets you authenticate endpoints using a JSON web token. It is intended to be used to secure RESTful endpoints without sessions.

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON-based open standard (RFC 7519) for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin. The tokens are signed by the server's key, so the client and server are both able to verify that the token is legitimate.
