## Installing Mongo

You will be writing and using Mongo from a JavaScript library in your applications, but it is not written in JavaScript.  This is similar to Node, an application written in C++ that can execute JavaScript.  

So, in order to use MongoDB locally in your applications, you will need to install Mongo & it's CLI (or Shell).  You will then be able to run & manage a local MongoDB database from your command line.
